Analivegam,leafspot,"Fungal or bacterial infection forming brown or black spots on leaves, leading to yellowing and premature leaf drop","Remove infected leaves, avoid excess moisture, improve air circulation, apply fungicides or bactericides if needed"
Betel,anthracnose,"Fungal disease causing dark, sunken spots on leaves, leading to leaf drop and reduced plant growth, especially in humid conditions","Remove and destroy infected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid excess moisture, and apply copper-based fungicides"
Blackpepper,leafspot,"Dark or brown spots appear on pepper plant leaves, often leading to reduced growth and yield, typically caused by fungal or bacterial infections."," Remove infected leaves, maintain proper spacing, avoid water accumulation, and apply fungicides or bactericides as required."
Cinnamon,shorthole,"Fungal infection causing small, circular holes in leaves due to tissue decay, often triggered by high humidity and poor air circulation","Prune affected leaves, ensure proper spacing, avoid overhead watering, apply fungicides, and maintain garden hygiene"
Citronella,blast,"Fungal infection causing grayish or brown lesions with dark borders on leaves, leading to wilting, yellowing, and reduced oil yield. Thrives in high humidity and warm temperatures.","Remove infected leaves, ensure proper spacing for airflow, avoid overhead watering, use balanced fertilizers, apply neem oil or Trichoderma-based biopesticides, and use fungicides like Tricyclazole if severe."
Desmodium,leafspot,"Leaf spot in Desmodium is a fungal or bacterial disease that causes small, circular to irregular brown or black spots on the leaves. These spots may enlarge over time, leading to yellowing and premature leaf drop. It can be caused by high humidity, poor air circulation, or infected plant debris","Remove infected leaves, avoid overhead watering, ensure proper spacing, apply fungicides or bactericides if needed, and maintain garden hygiene"
Krishnatulasi,leafspot,"Fungal or bacterial infection causing small dark or yellowish spots on leaves, which may enlarge, leading to leaf curling, yellowing, and premature drop. Often caused by high humidity and poor air circulation.","Remove infected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, apply neem oil or Trichoderma-based biopesticides, and use copper-based fungicides or bactericides if severe."
Noni,anthracnose,"Fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum spp., leading to dark, sunken lesions on leaves, fruits, and stems. Infected areas may turn black and spread rapidly, especially in humid conditions.","Prune infected parts, improve air circulation, apply copper-based fungicides, avoid overhead watering, and ensure proper drainage to reduce humidity."
Plumeria,rust,"Fungal disease causing orange or yellowish powdery spots on leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced plant vigor.","Remove and destroy infected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid water splashing, and apply sulfur-based fungicides."
Thippili,leafspot,"Circular or irregular dark spots develop on leaves, leading to yellowing and reduced plant vigor, usually caused by fungal infections","Cut off infected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and apply suitable fungicides."
Vellamodhakam,algalrust,"Algal infection forming white or grayish patches on leaves, often due to excessive moisture and poor air circulation","Remove affected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid excess moisture, apply copper-based fungicides, and keep the plant area clean"
kacholam,leafblight,"Fungal disease causing irregular brown lesions on leaves, leading to drying and curling, often due to high humidity","Cut off infected leaves, avoid water splashing, use well-drained soil, apply fungicides, and ensure proper ventilation"
